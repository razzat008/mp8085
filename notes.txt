8085 microprocessor notes:
- seven 8-bit registers: A, B, C, D, E, H, L
- A is the accumulator

Flags(8-bit):
S Z - AC - P - CY

S-> sign flag | holds arithematic sign of the result

Z-> zero flag | indicates whether the result of a mathematical/logical operation yields zero

AC-> auxiliary carry flag
	it holds the carry (half-carry) after 
	addition or borrows after subtraction between bit positions 3 and 4 of 
	the result in a BCD operation

P -> parity flag | count of no of ones in a number

C-> carry flag | indicates if carry/borrow is generated

program status word: A + Flags
